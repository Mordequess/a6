/*

The Bank is a monitor, which behaves like a server, that manages student-account information for all students.

Each studentâ€™s account initially starts with a balance of $0. 

The parent calls deposit to endow gifts to a specific student. 

A courier calls withdraw to transfer money on behalf of the WATCard office for a specific student. The
courier waits until enough money has been deposited, which may require multiple deposits.
