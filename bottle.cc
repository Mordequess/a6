/**
 * The bottling plant periodically produces random new quantities of each flavour of soda,
 * [0, MaxShippedPerFlavour] per flavour. The bottling plant is passed the number of vending machines,
 * NumVendingMachines, the maximum number of bottles of each flavour generated during a production run
 * and subsequently shipped, MaxShippedPerFlavour, the maximum number of bottles of each flavour in a
 * vending machine MaxStockPerFlavour, and the length of time between shipment pickups by the truck,
 * TimeBetweenShipments.
 *
 * It begins by creating a truck, performing a production run, and waiting for the truck to
 * pickup the production run. The truck then distributes these bottles to initialize the registered
 * vending machines.
 *
 * To simulate a production run of soda, the bottling plant yields for TimeBetweenShipments times
 * (not random). The truck calls getShipment to obtain a shipment from the plant (i.e., the production
 * run), and the shipment is copied into the cargo array passed by the truck.
 *
 * getShipment throws the exception Shutdown if the bottling plant is closing down and cargo is not changed.
 * A flag variable is necessary to know when to raise Shutdown on the correct task stack.
 *
 * The bottling plant does not start another production run until the truck has picked up the current run.
