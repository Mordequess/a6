/**
 * The truck moves soda from the bottling plant to the vending machines. The truck is passed the number of
 * vending machines, numVendingMachines, and the maximum number of bottles of each flavour in a vending
 * machine maxStockPerFlavour.
 *
 * The truck begins by obtaining the location of each vending machine from the name server.
 *
 * Before each shipment from the bottling plant, the truck yields a random number of times [1, 10]
 * to get a coffee from Tom Hortons.
 *
 * The truck then calls BottlingPlant::getShipment to obtain a new shipment of soda; any soda still on the
 * truck is thrown away as it is past its due date.
 *
 * If the bottling plant is closing down, the truck terminates.
 *
 * To ensure fairness, the vending machines are restocked in cyclic order starting at the vending machine
 * after the last machine the truck restocked, until there is no more soda on the truck or the truck has
 * made a complete cycle of all the vending machines; so there is no guarantee each vending machine
 * is completely restocked or the entire complement of vending machines is restocked or all the soda on
 * the truck is used.
 *
 * The truck can only restock up to MaxStockPerFlavour for each flavour in each vending machine (see
 * VendingMachine task).
