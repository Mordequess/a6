/*

The WATCard manages the money associated with a card. When a WATCard is created it has a $0 balance.

The courier calls deposit after a funds transfer. 

A vending machine calls withdraw when a soda is purchased.

A student and a vending machine call getBalance to determine the balance. 

FWATCard is a future pointer to a
studentâ€™s WATCard for synchronizing access to the WATCard between the student and the courier.
